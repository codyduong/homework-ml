This is a utility tool which scrapes Achieve HW questions and answers for machine learning training.

This scrapes from webpages which already have a known answer.

Takes in mhtml files from ```./input/filename.mhtml``` and exports to ```./output/filename.json```

* Right click save as on a question page, then save as a .mhtml file.

Some notes to myself:

Parse the MathML into some other form (probably Latex Math)
